## About

ProxyChat is an offline social communicator built fully in Swift, which utilizes the iOS Multipeer Connectivity framework to create a daisy-chaining, mesh network for data transmission. This provides the ability to communicate with other nearby users without the necessity of WiFi, cellular data, or bluetooth connectivity. This project was created and featured at TAMUHack2015, where it won 3rd Place overall, as well as Voter's Choice Award.

## Installation

To install and run ProxyChat on your own iOS device, simply clone the repository, open it via XCode, and build/run it on your own iDevice. To test connectivity and chat functionality, two seperate iDevices are required.

## Libraries Used

- JSQMessagesViewController
- Multipeer Connectivity
